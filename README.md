# Powershell-Profile
My personal profile for Windows Powershell.

The profile includes setting the starting location, minor customizations to the PowerShell GUI, list of modules to import, and a small welcome message.

DISCLAIMER:
If you would like to use this to build your own profile, the modules will most likely need to be removed. In order for the modules to properly load they must have been added via PS and source should be located within the "Modules" directory default location at `~/WindowsPowerShell/Modules`
